Summary:


• The Bike Sharing Service Program In New York City Was Active In August 2019. 

• The Majority Of Rides Turned Out To Be Located In Manhattan. 

• It Seems That Citi Bikes Are An Alternative To Public Transportation For Commuters (Who Are Mostly Men).


Two Additional Data Visualizations That I Recommend Be Created For Future Analysis Are:

• Generating Data Visualizations For More Months Throughout The Duration Of A Year To Determine More Bike Sharing Program Trends. 

• Generating Data Visualizations Incorporating Weather Data To Determine What Correlation Exists Between Bikesharing Rides And Weather Conditions.
